    "Negative integer cannot be prime numbers. So when the user enters any negative integer, a message displays saying \"You did not enter a positive integer\". When the user enters values as '0' a message displays saying \"0 is neither prime or composite\". Likewise when the user enters values as '1' a message displays saying \"1 is neither prime or composite\". When the user enters a valid positive interger, for loop is executed. For whatever the number entered by the user, the range is considered from 2 to the number before the entered number and for loop is executed for every number in the range list. So if the number entered is 5, the range is condsidered between 2 to 4, ie., 2,3,4. The if statement after the for loop will be executed and finds when the entered number by the user divided by the numbers in range list gives the remainder as '0' then it prints that the number is not a prime number and until it breaks the loop when all the numbers in the range list is executed. If when the entered number by the user divided by the numbers in range list gives the remainder that is not equal to '0' then it prints that the number is a prime number and until it breaks the loop when all the numbers in the range list is executed. For this program, the user has to run the script for every input."
